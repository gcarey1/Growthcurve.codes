This folder is for use with data files taken from the Synergy HTX plate reader in GERMS lab. Folder contains an Rmd script, to be customized as needed, and two example data files. Data files are Synergy HTX output, and a key in the necessary format for use with this script. Any data file taken directly from Synergy HTX should work with this script. Use the key (csv file) as a template for your own key.
